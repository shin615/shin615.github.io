            <h1>Seung Won's Assignment 2: Fade!</h1>
            <p>
            <img src="Fade.gif" width=400>
            </p>
            <p>
                This gif shows the Fade behavior that I exectued using the RGB LED and a pushbutton. Although the gif wasn't able to show the entire sequence, first the LED would flash through three different colors then, when the button is pressed the RGB LED would fade in a sequence of red, green, and finally blue. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To do this I modified two different code snippets shown in class and combined them. One was the pushbutton code and the other was the for loop used to make the LED fade. The entirety of the code is shown below.
            </p>

            One change that I made was that I changed the name of the variable that would store the data that checks whether the button was pushed was changed to pushCheck. In addition, I added in the code that would happen during the else, in this case what the LED would do when the button wasn't pushed. With this circuit when the button wasn't pushed it would flash through three colors each of which was a mix of the three colors at different intensities. The last change that I added was that every time the button was pushed I added in a reset where it would zero out the values of all three color elements to make sure it faded into the right colors.

            The three images above help show the circuit in detail. In this case I color coded the each of the wires connected to the pins that would feed into each of the elements of the RGB LED by color. So, the one that would go to the Red element got a red wire, the one that would go to the Green element got a green wire, and finally the wire that would go to the Blue element was blue. Accordingly because some of the LED elements had different voltage drops they got different resistors. Because the red LED and the green LED both have a voltage drop of 1.8 they were given 220 resistors, on the other hand because the blue LED has a voltage drop of 3.3 it was given a 100 resistor. For the pushbotton I put in a 10 k resistor because I read that it was the generic catchall that would be able to safely limit current flow with so many different wires going.

            Finally, the image above shows the schematic that I drew for this assignment's circuit. In this case I seperated into two seperate schematics. One is the schematic for the push button. In this schematic we can see that it starts at the 5V pin, which feeds into the pushbutton switch. Then, it goes to the #2 pin and the current flows through the 10 k resistor to end up in ground. The other schematic outlines the circuitry used for the RGB LED, each has the pin it starts at. Then, it leads to the resistors, 220 for red and green and 100 for the blue, then they all flow into the resistor where some voltage is lost, finally it flows to ground.
