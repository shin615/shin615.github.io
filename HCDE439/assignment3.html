                The gif shown above shows the RGB LED changing behavior based on the amount of light that is being shone on the photo resistor. For this sequence I had it just shine white by having all three colors turn on. Then, when the I covered the photoresistor it would flash through red, green, and blue until it was uncovered again.
            </p>
            <p>
                To do this I modified some code from the example code AnalogInOut Serial, along with adding the code that would make the LED flash how I wanted it to.

            I added variables for each of the output pins that corresponded to each of the colors of the RGB LED, then changed the output variable's name to outputValueLight to denote it would make whatever I put it on light up. So, with this code, when the sensor's value dropped below 690, which is what the reading was when light was shone on the sensor in just using the sensor moniter code without any light ups or anything and mapped from the 0-1023 values to 0-255, it would begin the sequence of flashing through red, green, and blue. Otherwise it would just shine white by having all three elements shine at the same time.

            The images shown above display the circuit created for this assignment. In this case on the upper part of the breadboard we can see the voltage divider comprised of a 10k Resistor and a Photoresistor, connected to the 5V power source, the A0 analog pin, and ground. On the lower part we see the RGB LED connected to three pins by three different wires. We can also see that each of the elements have the correct resistor with 220 resistors given to the red and green elements and a 100 resistor given to the blue element.

            This final image shows the schematics for the circuit used for this project along with the calculation used to figure out the resistor needed for the voltage divider. In this case the schematic for the voltage divider is shown seperately from the schematic for the RGB LED. The voltage divider schematic shows it starting at the 5V pin, traveling through the photoresistor, diverging to the A0 pin so that it can read the values from the photoresistor, then traveling through the 10K resistor before going to ground. With the RGB LED we see them start at their respective pins then traveling to the resistor for that element then traveling through the corresponding color LED before ending at ground. For the calculation that was used for finding the resistor that would accompany the photoresistor. We know that there is 5V traveling through the circuit and that a maximum of 40 mA can travel through the arduino so using Ohm's Law we know that a minimum of 125 Ohm resistor is required. However, in this case I used a 10K resistor because it covers the minimum resistance required and can match the 10K resistance that the photoresistor can reach so that we know voltage is being limited in every way possible.
