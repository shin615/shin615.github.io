            <h1>Seung Won's Assignment 6: The Web Talks Back!</h1>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                The gif above shows how I used the arduino, joystick, and p5 to create a circle that can be moved on the web. The joystick sends data about the position of the joystick into the arduino this is then sent through the p5 serial control program and through websockets is able to continuously write the data to a webpage. In this case the data written in manipulates the js code written to create a moveable shape. The web talks back part comes in when a key is pressed on the keyboard causing the shape to change color and the led to turn on
            </p>
            <p>
                The code used to accomplish this is based on the HCDE 439 example 2 code for the java script along with some code for the arduino taken from this post https://exploreembedded.com/wiki/Analog_JoyStick_with_Arduino. In addition the parts that were added for the arduino to receive data was taken from class examples along with this website https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/labs-serial-communication/lab-serial-output-from-p5-js/

            <p>
                The arduino only takes in the values from the joystick and writes them to the serial. The javascript then takes in the data and uses it to change the position of the circle drawn on the canvas. Then if an h or l is pressed on the computer it writes the those letters as data to the serial which is used by the the arduino to either turn on the led if h is sent or turn it off if l is sent. If data is sent then in the arduino it checks to see if the int incomingByte matches the ASCII decimal value for h which is 104 or if it matches the ASCII value for l which is 108 and depending on what it receives it either turns on or off the LED.

                The image above shows the circuit used for this assignment. In this case it is a very simple circuit connecting the ground on the joystick to the ground on the arduino, the 5V on the joystick to the 5V on the arduino, the VRx on the joystick to A0, and the VRy on the joystick to A1. On the arduino side it has an LED connected to pin 9 with a resistor of 220.

            <p style="padding-bottom: 2em">
                Finally we have the schematic for this assignment it has the schematic for the joystick which was fairly simple and did not require calculations and for the LED which shows a green LED with a resistor of 220 because it has a voltage drop of 1.8 so with the current that usually flows through the arduino it would need a 220 resistor.
